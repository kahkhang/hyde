Singapore has 8.3 million mobile subscribers. This, coupled with the government's 
sensors and data feeds means we are constantly fed with data. 

Our application, Hyde, facilitates Real Time Situation Awareness over the 18
newly-form electoral regions [Hover over regions to show MPs etc]. 

Using OneMap as the basemap, Hyde incorporates both static and dynamic data to 
provide live update of the ground situation. 

Hyde displays social media posts geotagged by location and a scrolling social feed. [scroll social feed]

We also draw data from government sources for traffic data and PUB water levels.

Colours of the pins provide a visual sentiment analysis of the country, or specific regions, if you wish.
Select a particular region and the sidebar updates the trending topics and the sentiment graph. [hover] 
(Which areas more happy/ generally people are quite happy...)

This is accompanied with a word cloud, showing the most trending topics.
Selecting words show us posts that contain them, like this morning someone at Pasir Ris was still
in awe at the spectacular fireworks she watched from Merlion Park last night. And people around the
country generally love food. 

As the topics change, we can have an indication of the buzz among the ground. 
We now know that ShapeRun is happening right now and people are excited about SG50, which is 
good news for the NDP committee. In contrast, if words like Riot and Rage start appearing,
perhaps crisis preparation should be considered. [Click on words]

[Zoom in to traffic data] 
We can also see which areas have the slowest traffic speeds and number of traffic accidents.
Social media can give us a faster indication of traffic incidents and speeds as compared to LTA data.

And you know, sometimes people are more gloomy on rainy days, so we have water level data
from PUB's sensors, which is used to indicate rain conditions. But today the water level is 
about 0.35 which means it's sunny; and overall, Singapore is happy. [Show overall sentiment]

[pause & return to overall country map]
Ladies and Gentlemen, we present Hyde, an aggregation of crowd-sourced social media data and 
sentiment analysis, government traffic and water data, providing a graphical representation on
OneMap facilitating Real Time Situational Awareness, by country and by electoral boundaries.
