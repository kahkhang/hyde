## A discussion with Daryl 

### Ideas
* Combining multiple data sources and displaying them 
* E.g. Property rental + traffic conditions 
* E.g. MERS outbreak from WHO website -> text analysis -> statistics on a dashboard and pushpins on a map
* [HDB Property Stuff](http://www.teoalida.com/singapore/hdbdatabase/)
* [Real time Tweets Mapped live](http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/interactive/2012/jun/18/real-time-tweets-mapped-twitter-live)

### Tools 
* http-fox FireFox extension  

### Food for Thought
* [A Call for a Creative and Smart Open Nation](https://medium.com/@hunternield/call-for-a-creative-and-open-smart-nation-2a82f43318d1)
