# Computer Vision
An exploration of everything virtual 

### Current Technologies 
* Leap Motion (Gesture)
* Oculus Rift (VR)
* OVRVision for Oculus Rift (AR)
* HoloLens 

[Microsoft’s HoloLens Will Make You Sick] (http://omnifeed.com/article/www.wired.com/%3Fp=1748238)
* Google Cardboard
* Samsung Gear VR 
* [Intel RealSense 3D hardware & SDK] 
(http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/realsense-3d-camera.html) 

### Development 
* Unity: Just released Unity 5.1 with Native Oculus Rift Support 
* [OpenCVSharp](https://github.com/shimat/opencvsharp)
* [OpenCVSharp + OVRVision](http://pafuhana1213.hatenablog.com/entry/2014/12/06/182458)
* [OpenCVSharp + OVRVision2](http://izmiz.hateblo.jp/entry/2014/12/07/000228)
* [BoofCV] (http://boofcv.org/index.php?title=Main_Page) is an open source Java library for real-time computer vision and robotics applications 

### Faces 

* [Reallusion FaceFilter](http://www.reallusion.com/facefilter/default.aspx, http://www.reallusion.com/ContentStore/promo/2012_MakeupPro/)
* Scan face in full 3D using only phone (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLMOpt5invA 
http://seene.co/), purpose=instead of a “stick man” in 3D virtual environment, have a 3D representation of trainee. 

### Ideas and current work 
* NDTV reported that BAE systems has collaborated with Birmingham University to develop a "mixed" reality system that combines real world data with a virtual interface that can project a battlefield onto any surface, and combine it with real-time video chat and live feeds to form a virtual command centre. BAE's previously developed Striker II helmet simply adds augmented reality to a physical cockpit dashboard, but the new concept would completely replace the physical controls, instead only showing contextual information. 
* “Poster-man” video collaboration
* Shared battleship-style situation awareness
* Chroma effect of collaboration environment to put everyone “out-in-the-field” – experiential-feel, transparent (tank) armour (toggle to Thermal and IR sensors)
* Gesture, vision (AR), virtual (VR), voice (Dragon-speak).
