Using social media for enhanced real-time situational awareness and decision support

With the rise in popularity of social media, the explosion in available
information now spans multiple platforms and formats. Social media provides real-time
content-rich profile updates and video and photo posts.

Policy makers can leverage on social media on top of traditional data sources such as 
geographical data, LTA traffic data, PUB water data and polyclinic data, to gather 
and share real-time, dynamic information to enhance and assist situational awareness and decision making.

To truly enhance situational awareness, essential elements such as sentiment of social media must be 
identified integrated technically and contextually to the larger information environment. 

If integrated with traditional data, social media can help achieve real-time
situational awareness. This will assist with decision-making, planning, and resource allocation. 

High-volume, high-velocity, and high-variety information assets from both static and dynamic data 
demand cost-effective, innovative forms of information processing for enhanced insight and decisionmaking.

by sentiment using NLP techniques, to complement available open government data. [This is Ji An's instagram caption]

Things we have: 
A wide variety of visualiation tools to aggregate and analyze social media for situational awareness.
- Word cloud: Show what people care about 
- Sentiment chart
- Select/ multi-select by regions: address issues close to ground & identify spatial-temporal characteristics
- Water levels: make correlations about weather and other data
- Traffic incidents/ traffic feed: faster reporting, congested roads (need to relook/ roadworks improvements)
- Health data measured by polyclinic number of patients: which district falling sick more often,
could further investigate cause (i.e. dengue) and help mitigate

Social media:
Active: 
- Gain valuable feedback by engaging the public on specific issues (i.e. news on new housing regulations)
-> Can point out the reply button
- Or seeking assistance to clarify information (i.e. someone tweets about traffic jam) -> crisis crowdsourcing
Passive: 
Observe chatter about own constitutions and identify and respond to issues/ rumours 

Situational Awareness is: 
•	 Knowing and understanding what is happening around you
•	 Predicting how it will change with time
•	 Being unified with the dynamics of your environment (i.e., contextualization with the current
environment given specific factors, variables, goals, and objectives)


The DHS Homeland Security Studies and Analysis Institute
summarized several capabilities that the participants identified as necessary or useful, including48:
•	 The ability to display emerging Twitter hashtags by topic area, bounded by geographic location, to
identify potential urgent circumstances (e.g., power outage, floods)
•	 The ability to know an urgent event occurred, identify trending topics (tweeted hashtags or
keywords) within a geographic location, and to understand real-time public sentiment
•	 The ability to identify influencers (profiles that appear to impact behavior of the crowd)
•	 The ability to determine the severity of a specific situation through imagery and text
•	 The ability to overlay more than one data input on a map to determine correlation or causation
(e.g., overlaying weather data on top of power outage data to determine if the weather caused
the power outages)
•	 The ability to identify resource or damage levels within a geographic area (e.g., availability of gas)
•	 The ability to visually overlay social media data on top of existing data input layers (e.g., power
outage data provided by utilities or road condition data provided by Google maps to identify areas
that are at risk, and also vulnerable due to demographics, special needs, etc.) to verify the
occurrence and understand the cause
•	 The ability to understand why an event occurred, why a topic is trending, and why public
sentiment is either positive or negative
•	 The ability to understand the severity of broad conditions (e.g., how long drivers remain stationary
on a highway)
•	 The ability to drill down into specific trending subject areas
•	 The ability to validate social media content without human intervention (e.g., automated facial
recognition software that searches for potential suspects given specific variables or evidence)
•	 The ability to filter urgent requests for assistance from a large volume of social media information 
•	 The ability to gauge public reaction and response to official messages
